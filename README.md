# Renyi-Entropy-Complexity-Causality-Space
This repository contains example code for the paper titled “Renyi Entropy-Complexity Causality Space: A Novel Neurocomputational Tool for Detecting Scale-Free Features in EEG/iEEG Data”.

These codes implement the ordpy library to apply the Bandt and Pompe methodology (A. A. B. Pessa, H. V. Ribeiro, ordpy: A Python package for data analysis with permutation entropy and ordinal network methods, Chaos 31, 063110 (2021). arXiv:2102.06786. https://arthurpessa.github.io/ordpy/_build/html/index.html).

The implemented dataset can be downloaded from: https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca/

Many of the images in the paper were generated using OCTAVE/MATLAB code since these environments facilitate the representation of these results. You can communicate with the authors if you need help implementing these methodologies in these languages. (guisande.natali@fisica.unlp.edu.ar // f.montani@fisica.unlp.edu.ar)
