# Renyi-Entropy-Complexity-Causality-Space
This repository contains example code for the paper “Renyi Entropy-Complexity Causality Space: A Novel Neurocomputational Tool for Detecting Scale-Free Features in EEG/iEEG Data”.
Many of the images in the paper were generated using OCTAVE/MATLAB code since these environments facilitate the representation of these results. You can communicate with the authors if you need help implementing these methodologies in these languages. (guisande.natali@fisica.unlp.edu.ar//f.montani@fisica.unlp.edu.ar)
